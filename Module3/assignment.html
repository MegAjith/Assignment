      <p>
        Chickens are mostly classified according to their best use: Broiler-fryers are up to 3 1/2 pounds, 2 1/2 months old. Roasters (have greater fat content so better roasted) are 2 1/2 - 5 pounds, up to 8 months old. Stewing chickens, aka hens, boiling fowl, and fowl, are 3-6 pounds, 10-18 months old. A capon is a rooster castrated before 8 weeks, up to 10 months old, 4-10 pounds with large tender breasts from a fattening diet, perfect for roasting. Rock Cornish game hens are hybrid of Cornish and White Rock chickens which are up to 2 1/2 pounds, between 4 and 6 weeks old (because of their small size they are often served one per person). Squab chicken, aka poussin in French, are not squab, but are small less than 1 1/2 pound chickens, between 4 and 6 weeks old. Cocks and roosters are older, tougher birds, best of soups and broths. Free-range chickens are guaranteed 2 square foot of space each indoors and freedom to roam outside (as opposed to mass-produced chickens which only have 1 square foot on indoor space), and are often fed a special diet free of antibiotics, growth enhanders or hormones, which is said to give them a better flavor.
        HOW TO SELECT
Available fresh or frozen, whole or in parts or ground. Look for meaty chickens with smooth soft skin (skin color differs depending on the breed and diet, so is not a good indication of quality).

HOW TO STORE
Remove from tight plastic wrap and store in waxed paper to prevent bacterial growth. Keep in the coldest part of the refrigerator for up to 2 days or cooked up to 3 days. Keeps frozen up to 2 months.

HOW TO PREPARE
Handle raw chicken carefully and never eat raw. Wash all tools, surfaces and hands which touch raw chicken thoroughly with soap before they come in contact with anything else. Cook chicken to an internal temperature of 180 degrees F. bake, braise, broil, fry, grill, marinate, roast, saute

    <div id="Beef"  class="col-xs-12 item">
      <h3 class="text-center">Beef</h3>
      <p>
        Beef, flesh of mature cattle, as distinguished from veal, the flesh of calves. The best beef is obtained from early maturing, special beef breeds. High-quality beef has firm, velvety, fine-grained lean, bright red in colour and well-marbled. The fat is smooth, creamy white, and well distributed. In young beef the bones are soft, porous, and red; the less desirable mature beef has hard white bones. Beef tenderness and flavour are improved by aging; in one common aging method the carcass is hung for about two weeks at approximately 36 °F (2 °C), encouraging physical changes in the muscle tissue that enhance the quality of the meat.
        Grading standards are somewhat similar in various countries; there is a large international beef trade. In the United States, grades in order of quality are prime, choice, good, commercial, utility, cutter, and canner. Commercial grades are mainly from mature cattle, especially cows. Utility, cutter, and canner grades are used in processed meat products. Beef hide, used for leather manufacture, is a valuable by-product of beef.

The primary beef-consuming countries of the world (in per capita terms) are Uruguay, Argentina, New Zealand, Australia, and the United States. Beef is relatively scarce—and not particularly popular—in most of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent; the sanctity of the cow in the Hindu religion forbids the consumption of its meat by Hindu adherents. Beef is not unusual in the cuisines of Korea and Japan, however; in Kōbe, Japan, near Ōsaka, a highly prized beef is produced from cattle that are vigorously massaged and fed a liberal dietary supplement of beer.

Butchering practices differ among countries, resulting in a variety of names for the different cuts. In the United States, where beef is the most popular meat, steaks—cross-sections from the fleshier parts of the carcass—are among the most desirable cuts. The standing rib roast, called in Britain the best rib, is also a valued cut. Less desirable cuts may be pot-roasted, used in stews, or ground (see hamburger). Boiled beef is popular in some cuisines, as in the French dish known as pot-au-feu. Corned beef (or salt beef in Britain) is a brisket or rump cut that has been pickled in brine.

      <h3 class="text-center">Sushi</h3>
      <p>
        At some point in time, what possibly began as a method to preserve fish in the Mekong Valley of Southeast Asia, the sushi travelled to Japan and over the centuries of its existence reached such high levels of evolution that today it’s pretty much an art form.

(Sushi, Sliced and Diced)

In the American documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi, Ono Jiro says, “The most important part of making good sushi is this: creating a union between the rice and the fish.  If they are not in complete harmony, the sushi won't taste good.” And he could not have been more accurate.

A popular feature in Japanese cuisine the world over, the modern sushi rarely looks like its original self today. Chef Kamlesh Joshi of EDO, ITC Gardenia Bengaluru has been working with Japanese food for more than a decade, and says that when he began his career in New Delhi, it was the one cuisine that surprised him immensely. “I couldn’t imagine people were eating raw fish,” he says.

The Art of Eating Sushi

For a first timer, the art of eating sushi can be a formidable task. But the tricks are fairly simple if you don’t let the whole presentation of it get to you. Sushi is typically served with three condiments on the side - soy sauce, a dollop of wasabi (a dry green paste), and gari (pickled ginger). Interestingly, it’s hard to source real wasabi, which is actually a plant, outside of Japan. Most restaurants replace it with horseradish, which has the similar pungency of the wasabi plant, mustard, starch, and the green food colouring of course. Real wasabi is way more pungent than we are used to.Japanese cuisine added to world heritage list

Traditionally, sushi is eaten with hands, and this is also why you ought to wash your hands before you start. In the case of a nigiri, you need to turn the sushi around (rice up, fish down), lightly dip it into the soy making sure that you don’t dip the whole thing in, and eat it. For convenience what you can also do is mix the wasabi in the soy and then dip the sushi into it. Usually, chefs smear a little bit of wasabi between the fish and the rice; the extra bit is given if you want more.
